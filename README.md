Hey, I'm Marcel, Linux enthusiast and programmer.

I enjoy learning new stuff, here are some topics that I liked so far:
- Server Administration
- Programming (C#, Rust, Python, Web)
- Linux (Personal Servers, Desktop)
- Server Infrastructure Architecture
- CI / CD
- Network Architecture


Some of my goals are:
- Become a [TU](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Trusted_Users)
- Get a PR merged into the linux kernel
- Work on a active open source project
